## An edge-based color-aided method for license plate detection (2008 - Elsevier)

    Focus: Iranian license plates. 

They researched on two major areas: to enhance image contrast in plate-like regions, and a novel match filter to eliminate non-plate like regions. Their approach was referenced in many papers.

## A License Plate-Recognition Algorithm for Intelligent Transportation System Applications (2006 IEEE)

    Focus: USA license plates
    Accuracy: Total = 86.0%
        Segmentation = 96.5%
        Recognition = 89.1%

This paper provides an in-dept literature review. 

> In this paper, an algorithm implementing a novel adaptive image segmentation technique (SCWs) and connected component analysis is considered for license plate location and character segmentation. For the OCR task, a PNN with topology 108-180-36 is trained to identify alphanumeric characters, which were previously isolated from the candidate area.

## Bangla Automatic Number Plate Recognition System using Artificial Neural Network (2012 - ATST)

    Accuracy: Total = 75.51%
        Detection & Extraction = 92.1%
        Character Segmentation = 97.53%
        Character Recognition  = 84.16%

They provided a generalized method for the task excluding embassy and military cars. The detection was done by gaussian filter and extraction by contour analysis. Horizontal and vertical projection was used to segment characters. They kept the city-name together as a whole. To recognize a 3 layer MLP was used of dimension: `25 x 158 x 40`. 25 features are extracted manually from segmented letters.

> The classes include private vehicle and commercial vehicles. Other categories of vehicles, such as embassy cars and military cars are not addressed since they are rarely seen.

## A New Approach for License Plate Detection and Localization: Between Reality and Applicability (2015 - IBR)

    Target: Arabian Plates
    Accuracy: 93.1

Upto detection. Uses histrogram equalization for enhancing constrast. First selects interesting rows, then columns.

## License Plate Localization from Vehicle Images: An Edge Based Multi-stage Approach (2009 IJRTE)

    Accuracy: 89.2% (#FN: 8%, #FP: 2.8%)

Upto detection. Histrogram based contrast enhancement. Has detailed and algorithm description of localization process.
